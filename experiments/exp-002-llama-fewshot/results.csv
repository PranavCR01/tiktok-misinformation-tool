People on this app are ruthless. I don't think I've ever had so many hateful things said about me in such a short period of time. I agree. People on TikTok can be kind of spicy, but compared to YouTube, you guys are angels. I was preemptively blocked by this creator, but this video detailing the specific food she doesn't eat at the grocery store or in explaining why your cereal is a spawn of Satan. Got 6 million views! And per her video I stitched, it didn't seem like her message was received very well. Let's talk about why. To begin, videos where a random person tells you the specific foods that they avoid at the grocery store aren't really that helpful. I know it sounds callous, but I don't care. Everyone has different dietary needs, food preferences, medical conditions, cultural diets, food allergies, access to food, food budgets, and if she buys Cheerios or not at the grocery store, that doesn't affect any of those factors for me personally. That is until she starts spreading misinformation about Cheerios which may reach a vulnerable parent who feeds their toddler Cheerios because they are a shelf stable, cheap, palatable source of iron. This is where we run into more trouble. Our other issue is that if you use an appeal to authority tactic to establish yourself as an expert, like you have a food science and an agriculture degree, when food science topics like the amount of glyphosate residues, or agriculture topics like the carcinogenicity of glyphosate come up, you need to get your facts correct. And if you don't, people might not be very happy. Granted, I don't know if glyphosate residues on Cheerios is more food science or food cam but potato potato. Regardless, we know that Cheerios do not have high amounts of glyphosate residues. This is a post by food science babe from the Graham. And when the EWG tested Cheerios for glyphosate residues, values measured at 833 parts per billion, which is significantly below EPA tolerance levels, so a 150 pound adult would have to eat over 5000 cups a day for a prolonged period of time for glyphosate to become an issue. 5000 cups every day, 4 months and months. Good luck with that. Now if someone has agriculture knowledge, this my friends is a no brainer. The Bayer lawsuit had to do with farmers using glyphosate in combination with other pesticides for decades and inhaled. This had nothing to do with food. And when research actually studied this further and looked at glyphosate independently, it wasn't significantly associated with cancer at any site in a study of 54,000 people. And a look at 15 government agencies and their consensus on glyphosate, not genotoxic doesn't represent a risk of cancer, not carcinogenic, not neurotoxic, etc. So enjoy your Cheerios, even the Reese's Pups are still better.
