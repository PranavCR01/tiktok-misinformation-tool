baseline,mistral,Dr. Austin-2.mp4,"Last month was black history month and this month is colorectal cancer, we're in this month, so let's talk about it. I'm a gastroenterologist and black Americans are 20% more likely to get colorectal cancer and 40% more likely to die of colorectal cancer. There are a lot of reasons behind these disparities, but there are three things I want to highlight. Number one, systemic racism. This could affect how people are getting referred for cancer screening, how early they're getting their cancer treated, and this could further the mistrust in medicine because of how they were treated by a health care system in the past. Number two, access. Access to good care, access to good information, access to a good environment where you're less likely to pick up unhealthy habits and develop other conditions that might put you at risk of developing cancer. Number three, representation in clinical trials. We run the risk of under-treating black Americans because in the past they weren't included in clinical trials, so that research might not always apply to black Americans if they're not represented in that research. Anyway, get screened if you're 45. It's highly preventable if you can detect it early and treat it early.

I have been an endocrinologist for 24 years. So apparently they're trained in every specialty and pay attention to the lip syncing. 13 years as a butt doctor yet no body believed. No body? So the pronunciation is off. The lip syncing is off. The years are inconsistent. When 13 years as a butt doctor yet no one, I have been a butt doctor for 12 years and still no one. 17 years as a butt doctor and no one.

baseline,mistral,dr.kennedy.mp4,"Okay, three myths about modern medicine that I still believe are very important are the first of this is the importance of continued activity, continued exercise. Walking is a fantastic way to increase your body's activities and keep moving and to decrease the chance of having long term musculoskeletal health issues. Number two is the importance of old foods and non-processed foods. There is way too much injection of processed food which have been shown to be detrimental to your body. The third myth is the advantage of retirement. People my age are dropping by the size of where I am still active and working. So it is very important that you continue to be active, working part time or even full time, well past the typical retirement age of 60 or 65. Keep moving no matter what and no matter what temporary difficulty you're presently having. And of these three myths that we talked about which I believe are still very important which one of these was the most important and meaningful to you.",NO_MISINFO,continued activity;exercise;long term musculoskeletal health issues;old foods;non-processed foods;processed food;detrimental;retirement;part time work;full time work,0.95,22.57
baseline,mistral,dr.nicole.vangroningen.mp4,"I need to bust some very big and problematic myths about AMA discharges that's when patients leave the hospital against medical advice. The biggest myth that I hear is that if patients choose to leave the hospital against medical advice or AMA, that they will be financially responsible for their stay, that their health insurance won't actually pay for it. I don't even know where this comes from, but I was told this more than once when I was in my training. Sometimes the patients have to leave the hospital for like actually legitimate reasons, like their child doesn't have child care. This is a true story that has happened, and that doesn't mean that they're going to have to pay their whole hospital bill out of pocket. We need to stop telling patients this. The second myth is that if a patient decides to leave the hospital against medical advice, they are required to fill out this special document that it tests they understand the risks and benefits of doing so, and they're leaving AMA. This has actually never been shown. This document has never been shown to be helpful in a court of law in protecting any doctor from liability, but the myth is that it is required to protect doctors against liability. There's never been a study or really any good evidence that actually shows that this is true. What we also know is that when providers on the care team document that the patient left AMA, which is done all the time, that actually creates stigma that biases future providers against that patient, what we should do instead is treat the decision to continue or not continue the hospitalization like any other medical decision. When we talk to patients about a medication that would help them or a surgery that would help them, talk about the risks and benefits and alternatives, make sure that they fully understand, and then document the conversation. I also think in some cases, it's actually helpful and appropriate to document why the patient had to leave. If they had to appear in court for whatever reason, if they had to pay a really important bill, or if they had to go take care of their kid, these are all reasons that are legitimate reasons for leaving the hospital, but don't mean that the patient is just like non-adherent or non-compliant. So no need for threats, no need for scary paperwork, no stigmatizing language, just normal routine medical care.",DEBUNKING,AMA discharges;patients leaving hospital against medical advice;financial responsibility;health insurance;special document;liability protection;stigma;medical decision;documentation;non-adherence;compliance,0.95,27.69
baseline,mistral,drefratlamandre.mp4,"Let's do a fun interactive one today. What's a medical thing you were told as a child that you found out when you grew up was completely wrong? I'll go first. When I was a kid, I was told that if you go outside with what hair, that that is how you get sick. And of course, I found out that that's not the case. Now to our turn, what's the thing you were told that you found out was completely wrong? I look forward to seeing it in the comments.",MISINFO,childhood;medical advice;hair outside;get sick,0.95,13.24
baseline,mistral,drevan.mp4,"As a cardiologist, what's one heart health myth you want to debunk? Many patients come in to see me for the first time and they think that their total cholesterol is an important number to follow. And it is not very important. We know so much more about cholesterol than total cholesterol. So even if your total cholesterol is good, it does not mean that you are not at risk for heart disease or stroke. That exercise every day does not mean that you can't have a cardiovascular problem. Sometimes people think that resting is important. It's not exercise is important getting out and doing things every single day that can raise your heart rate, get your back into some physical conditioning. But resting is not really in your best interest at all. At a certain point for many people, diet, exercise, another lifestyle based interventions might not be enough in terms of improving heart health. This is especially the case if you've been diagnosed with medical issues like high blood pressure or high cholesterol. In those cases, you may also need medical interventions as well. So sometimes when people say heart disease, they only think about heart attacks and strokes, which are usually caused by atherosclerosis. But in fact, it's important to remember that there are many other forms of heart disease. Some patients think that statins are bad for them because of what they read on the internet. And statins are really good medications. They've helped prevent strokes, heart attacks, and also help patients with their health in general.",DEBUNKING,total cholesterol;heart health;exercise;resting;diet;lifestyle;statins;atherosclerosis;heart disease;medical interventions,0.95,22.75
