# Experiment 003: Enhanced Chain of Thought (COT) Misinformation Detection

## Overview
This experiment tests an enhanced Chain of Thought prompting approach for TikTok misinformation detection. Building on the basic COT prompt from exp-002, this version implements a comprehensive 8-step reasoning process to improve classification accuracy and confidence.

## Enhanced COT Process
The enhanced prompt guides the model through:

1. **Transcript Understanding** - Context and speaker analysis
2. **Claim Identification** - Extract all health-related claims and facts  
3. **Source Credibility Assessment** - Evaluate expertise and authority indicators
4. **Fact-Checking Analysis** - Compare against scientific consensus
5. **Harm Potential Evaluation** - Assess potential for harmful health decisions
6. **Content Categorization** - Systematic classification approach
7. **Confidence Assessment** - Quantify certainty in classification
8. **Keyword Extraction** - Identify key health-related terms

## Hypothesis
The enhanced step-by-step reasoning process should:
- Improve classification accuracy compared to basic COT
- Provide more consistent confidence scores
- Better identify edge cases and ambiguous content
- Generate more relevant keywords for health topics

## Configuration
- **Model**: Mistral (via Ollama)
- **Temperature**: 0.0 (deterministic)
- **Prompt Type**: enhanced_cot
- **ASR Provider**: Local (faster-whisper)

## Expected Improvements
Compared to exp-002-mistral-cot:
- Higher accuracy on borderline cases
- More reliable confidence scoring
- Better handling of complex health discussions
- Improved keyword relevance and completeness

## Analysis Plan
After running, compare with exp-002 results:
- Classification accuracy differences
- Confidence score distributions  
- Keyword quality and relevance
- Processing time differences
- Error pattern analysis
