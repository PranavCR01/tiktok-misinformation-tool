temperature: 0.0                 # 0.0 = deterministic, higher = more creative

notes: "Brief description of experiment goals"

# Prompt Types Explained:
# - baseline: Standard classification prompt
# - fewshot: Includes example classifications for calibration
# - reasoned: Asks LLM to think step-by-step (may be slower)

# Temperature Guidelines:
# - 0.0: Reproducible, deterministic (recommended for experiments)
# - 0.3-0.7: Balanced creativity
# - 1.0+: More creative but less consistent
